									<h2 id="content">Mechatronics</h2>
									<p>This course provides students with the tools required to design, model, analyse and control mechatronic systems; i.e.
									smart systems comprising electronic, mechanical, fluid and thermal components. The techniques for modelling various
									system components will be studied in a unified approach developing tools for the simulation of the performance of these
									systems. Analysis will also be made of the various components needed to design and control mechatronic systems including
									sensing, actuating, and I/O interfacing components.</p>
									<p>Students who successfully complete the course should have reliably demonstrated the ability to:
									(i) Use the basic tools required to design, model, analyze and control mechatronic systems.
									(ii) Work with smart systems comprising electronic, mechanical, fluid and thermal components.
									(iii) Model a wide variety of system components in a unified way.
									(iv) Establish the performance of components in mechatronic systems.
									(v) Analyze various components needed to design and control mechatronic systems.
									(vi) Apply the material covered in the program to the design of sensing devices and actuating devices.
									(vii) Deal with I/O interfacing components in mechatronic systems.</p>
									<h2 id="content">Advanced Mechatronics</h2>
									<p>The focus of this course is to provide the tools required to design, model, analyse and control mechatronic systems.
									Modelling of various system components into a unified approach and tools for the simulation of the performance of these
									systems; characteristics of typical mechatronics systems in terms of their impacts on enhancement of performance, speed
									of operation, and physical size; applications of mechatronics to robotics and automation industry, and other intelligent
									systems.</p>
									<p>Students who successfully complete the course should have reliably demonstrated the ability to:
									1. Understand the basic principles involved in the design of mechatronic systems.
									2. Understand and able to apply machine vision in mechatronics systems.
									3. Have a thorough knowledge of artificial intelligence and its applications in mechatronics systems.

									<h2 id="content">Robotics and Automation</h2>
									<p>Industrial robots; robot kinematics, differential kinematics; statics, dynamics and control of robot arms; non-contact
									and contact sensors; actuators; real-time joint control; task planning and programming of industrial robots;
									applications of robots.</p>
									<p>Students who successfully complete the course should have reliably demonstrated the ability to:
									1. Classify industrial robots and know the uses of industrial robots.
									2. Analyze the kinematics associated with complex robot motion.â€¨
									3. Establish the dynamics of robot arms and how to control the arms.
									4. Analyze actuators and real-time joint control systems.

									<h2 id="content">Advanced Robotics and Automation</h2>
									<p>This course builds upon the knowledge students have gained in a first robotics course to cover more advanced kinematics
									topics and their application to more complex robotic systems such as redundant manipulators, parallel mechanisms and
									mobile robots. Topics will include, but not be limited to: robotic manipulators, mobile robots, modeling and controls,
									vision in robotics and visual servoing.</p>
									<h2 id="content">Advanced Control</h2>
									<p>This course builds upon the knowledge students have gained in a first control course to cover more materials in advanced
									control systems. Topics covered will include: a. State variables and state space models: Relations between state space
									models and the transfer-function models (controllable and observable canonical forms, and diagonal form), Jordan form,
									solutions of linear state equations, transition matrix. b. Controllability and observability: Definition and criteria,
									state feedback and output feedback, pole assignment via state feedback, design of servo-controlled systems. c. State
									estimation and observer: Observer state-variable feedback control. d. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems: Pole
									assignment via state feedback. Introduction to Linear quadratic regulator (LQR), intelligent control and model
									predictive control.</p>
